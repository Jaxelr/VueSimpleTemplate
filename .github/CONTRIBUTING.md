# How to contribute

I've tried to keep the requirements to the minimum possible. 

## Pull requests.

* Please dont use a master branch for PRs.
* Rebase any relevant changes from upstream before asking for PRs.
* If various commits are submitted please try and rebase them on a cohesive structure.

## Styles

Just following the .editorconfig guidelines will suffice for now.
