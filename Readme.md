# Vue Template

This template was created to use vue .Js with asp.net core using the SPA services. It tries to be minimalistic with the approach. It also favors Vue's single component files instead of using Typescript.

To install the template locally execute the following command with the dotnet command

`dotnet new -i $PATH_OF_REPO`
